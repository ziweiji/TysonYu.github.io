I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Electronic and Computer Engineering Department and [Center for AI Research (CAiRE)](https://caire.ust.hk), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology supervised by [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk). 

My research interests lie primarily in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I mainly work on Hallucination in NLG, focusing on improving generation tasks' faithfulness. I have experience in Dialogue Generation, Question Generation, Named Entity Recognition, Multimodel (Vision-Language) Generation, and Fake News Detection.
